# Road_Map_to_Machine_Learning

Hey, this is Rashik Rahman a machine learning enthusiast. You can check out portfolio and projects [here](https://rashikrahman.github.io/Website/).


To get started first you need to install Anaconda. It is both a python and R distribution. Installing anaconda will by default setup python and allow you to access most of the needed machine learning, data science libraries i.e. nupmy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, jupyter lab, jupyter notebook etc. It is available in Windows, Linux and MacOS. Download it from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). To see windows installation documentation click [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/).

**IDE vs. NOTEBOOK**

After installing anaconda when you open anaconda navigator you'll see jupyter lab, jupyter notebook these are ipython notebooks and also you'll see Pycharm, VS Code, Spyder etc these are notebook. If you want you can install IDEs from here but by default you'll have notebooks installed. In my opinion using ipython notebook is best for data analysis, data visualization, and developing machine learning models. Using IDE to do these task isn't as efficient and user friendly as ipython notebook. Most of the data scientist now use jupyter lab to do their data science tasks. So what's the use of IDE? When you need to integrate a python script then you can use IDE. Personally, when I need to script a model in .py file or need to develop a project first I develop the model using notebook .ipynb file and then just copy paste the final version in the IDE to save it as .py file.Give it a try you'll see a huge difference.

## This is a road map to become a data scientist/to learn machine learning.

I'll enlist some courses and tutorials to get you started in this field. This is a zero to intermediate-level suggestion list maintaining the order.

### 1.[10 Days of Statistics](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-statistics?filters%5Bstatus%5D%5B%5D=unsolved&filters%5Bstatus%5D%5B%5D=solved&filters%5Bsubdomains%5D%5B%5D=10-days-of-statistics&badge_type=10-days-of-statistics)

For a data science/machine learning task you first need to understand the data and how to interpret data statistically. Statistics and probability are a must for data science tasks. This 10 days challenge will help you with that. You'll learn the basics of statistics & probability and some intermediate topics. Here you'll be given some problems for each day and there will be tutorials, solutions for them. My suggestion would be to watch the tutorials then try to solve the problem if you still can't solve it only then see the solution.


### 2.[IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science)

This specialization course is highly recommended to get you started in the world of Data Science. You'll learn the basics of SQL, Data Analysis, Data visualization, Machine learning. And finally, you'll be given a Capstone project to complete. Upon completion, you'll get a certificate given below. This is a paid course so to get the certificate you'll have to pay. But if you are financially unstable you can apply for financial aid. They'll reply within 15 days to let you know if your application is approved or not.
